The largest cluster (41.5%) was for genes with catalytic activity like phosphatases, kinases, and methyl/acetyl transferases, which makes sense because as the cells differentiate they will have to silence or activate genes though methlation/acetylation and inactivate or activate proteins through phosphorylation or dephosphorylation.
